= foo-dogsquared's NUR packages

My NUR packages, my second home.
(More like tenth but you get the point.)

This is a set of packages built at https://github.com/nix-community/NUR[NUR], a set of user-contributed packages.




== Setup

For now, it's not yet included at the NUR list so you'll have to directly access my NUR repo like the following:
footnote:[Pretty much, you can access anyone's NUR Git repo as long as they have similar setup to the NUR template at https://github.com/nix-community/nur-packages-template.]

[source, nix]
----
nixpkgs.config.packageOverrides = pkgs: {
  nur-foo-dogsquared = import (
    fetchTarball "https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/nix-expressions/archive/master.tar.gz") { inherit pkgs; }
  );
};
----

Then you can access the packages through `pkgs.nur-foo-dogsquared.$PKG`.
footnote:[The above solution was based from this https://discourse.nixos.org/t/using-a-nur-repo-without-adding-it-to-the-main-nur-repo/5591/4[post].]

You can look at the https://github.com/nix-community/NUR[official NUR README] for up-to-date instructions.
